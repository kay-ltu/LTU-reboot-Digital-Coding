REFLECTION

History of HTML, how to view and inspect source, overview of elements and attributes and how to write code using shortcuts and standard practice. 

Tasks included creating new files and folders, coding and pushing new files to Github, using these applications are new to me typically I use Dreamweaver so I appreciate the new persective and new way of working. 

I particularly enjoyed the shortcodes and extensions, thank you for those.

REFLECTION

Today we expanded upon HTML content including:
    Lists, both ordered and unordered for text and images
    Line Breaks to create space
    Tables and how used in emails
    Hyperlinks, both relative and absolute paths as text and images directing them to open in the same window or new tabs
    Inserting Email links using the mailto function

Tasks included creating pages demonstrating the above.

Still enjoying the shortcuts, external links and resources as well as your general discussions re. real world applications. Thanks and take care.

REFLECTION

Today we focused on CSS, really enjoyed your thorough approach again Luke, breaking it down to selector, property and value was a great way of looking at it objectively instead of just code it helps to respect the individual components, what they contribute and how they relate and communicate. 
Tasks included creating html pages and separate css files as industry best practice as I have learnt too, I do call them css but appreciate calling them styles is more logical and I'll try switch over from that :) We then changed various values to show the interaction with the html page changing.
We began looking at specific selectors divs and classes. Looking forward to next lesson.

REFLECTION

On our 8th session we focused on CSS, using ID's and classes and understood css rules are applied in either cascading order, specificity, and top-down read from the CSS sheet in terms of duplications. We also looked at shortcodes, shortcodes are excellent thank you.

We looked at divs, classes and how HTML5 have replaced some commonly used design elements with inspiration from newspapers to create new elements. Very pleased - much better.
We also looked at placements using the box model including inline and block elements, padding, margin and borders.

Might be useful to explain best practice for knowing which size units to use in terms of text and box sizes, I've had experience with all: ems, pixels and percents... perhaps your excellent way of explaining logic and real world examples could go into best practice and why for example in html emails vs flexible websites, would you mix units in the same website, or stick to percents for flexibility, or are separate CSS rules still written per device size with max-width pixels etc. Keeping up with changing trends is vast. Thank you.
