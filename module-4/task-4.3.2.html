ARRAY list of objects

            only need you to look through the list once and display results
            the result may change when ive read it so a var can be a let
            LET for loop through the list starting at 0 at each object in turn to hte bottom of the list, return title and author

            if boolean read = true - console log you alredy read it, go to next one + title + author)
            
            else boolean print you need to read it + title + author
